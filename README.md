# Serverless-Web-Application-on-AWS

# Description
        
In this project, I built a serverless web application using AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, and S3. The application will allow users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) items from a DynamoDB table.

**Steps to Build the Project:**    

•	Set up a DynamoDB database to store your application's data.       
•	Create a Lambda function that will handle all create, read, update, and delete operations for 
        the DynamoDB database.                      
•	Upload your website files (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) to Amazon S3 for storage and hosting.        
•	Set up a CloudFront distribution that will deliver your S3-hosted website files to users with minimal latency.   

**Outcome of the Project:**

•	After this project, I had created a fully functional serverless web application running on AWS.     
•	Gained practical experience developing with AWS's serverless technologies including Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, and CloudFront.     
•	I also developed expertise in connecting various AWS services to create a comprehensive application.     
•	This hands-on project enhanced my capabilities in cloud computing, serverless design principles, and AWS service implementation.
