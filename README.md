# Serverless-Web-Application-on-AWS

**Description:**          
In this project, I built a serverless web application using AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, and S3. The application will allow users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) items from a DynamoDB table.

**Architecture:**

**Steps to Build the Project:**  
•	Set up a DynamoDB database to store your application's data.       
•	Create a Lambda function that will handle all create, read, update, and delete operations for the DynamoDB database.              
•	Upload your website files (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) to Amazon S3 for storage and hosting.        
•	Set up a CloudFront distribution that will deliver your S3-hosted website files to users with minimal latency.
